To get started on your Bible website, I need some additional details:

Website Title and Main Purpose:

What is the title of the website? (e.g., "Bible Portal," "Scripture Study Hub")
What is the primary goal? (e.g., daily verses, Bible study tools, online sermons)
Key Features:

Do you want sections for Bible verses, sermons, study guides, prayer requests, etc.?
Should it include community features like forums or group discussions?
Contact Information:

Any social media links or email addresses you'd like to include?
Do you have a physical address or phone number to display?
Visual Preferences:

Should I stick to a traditional or modern design? (e.g., minimalistic, rich imagery of nature or churches)
Do you have a preferred color scheme? By default, I'll use dark orange and orange.
Images:

Should I find images, generate them, or will you provide your own? For example, a cross, a Bible, or serene landscapes.
Please provide these details, and Iâ€™ll create the initial design for you.
